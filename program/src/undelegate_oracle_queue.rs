/// Process the undelegation of an Oracle queue from the delegation program
///
/// This instruction allows an authority to undelegate an Oracle queue that was previously
/// delegated to the delegation program, removing the ability for other programs to interact
/// with the queue through the delegation mechanism.
///
/// Accounts:
///
/// 0. `[signer]` The authority that controls the Oracle queue
/// 1. `[writable]` The Oracle queue account to be undelegated
/// 2. `[]` The Magic context account
/// 3. `[]` The Magic program
///
/// Requirements:
///
/// - The authority (account 0) must be a signer.
/// - The Oracle queue (account 1) must be a valid PDA with seeds [QUEUE, authority.key, index].
/// - The Oracle queue must have been previously delegated to the delegation program.
///
/// Process:
/// 1. Parse the instruction data and extract arguments (UndelegateOracleQueue).
/// 2. Verify the authority is a signer.
/// 3. Verify the Oracle queue account has the correct PDA structure.
/// 4. Call the delegation program to commit and undelegate the Oracle queue account.
