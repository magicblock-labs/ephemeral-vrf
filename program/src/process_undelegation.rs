/// Process the undelegation of an Oracle queue from the delegation program
///
/// This instruction is a vrf-macro from the delegation program to complete the undelegation process
/// for an Oracle queue that was previously delegated. It's called by the delegation program as part
/// of the undelegation flow.
///
/// Accounts:
///
/// 0. `[signer]` The payer for the transaction
/// 1. `[writable]` The Oracle queue account being undelegated
/// 2. `[]` The delegation buffer account
/// 3. `[]` The system program
///
/// Requirements:
///
/// - The payer (account 0) must be a signer.
/// - The Oracle queue (account 1) must have been previously delegated to the delegation program.
/// - The delegation buffer (account 2) must be the correct PDA for this delegation.
///
/// Process:
/// 1. Load and validate the required accounts.
/// 2. Call the delegation program's undelegate_account function to complete the undelegation process.
